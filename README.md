#  Detox 
---

A mindful browser extension designed to help you break the cycle of social media addiction by strategically disrupting habit loops. Based on proven behavioral psychology principles.

> **Break the cycle, not the connection.**

---

##  How It Works

Detox targets the 4-part habit loop identified in addiction psychology:

1. **Cue** → *Disrupt with redirects and grayscale mode*
2. **Craving** → *Reduce with intentional pauses and feed removal*  
3. **Response** → *Make difficult with delays and friction*
4. **Reward** → *Diminish with hidden metrics and time limits*

##  Features
